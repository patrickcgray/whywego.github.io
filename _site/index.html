<p>Why We Go sits are the intersection of marine and space exploration. We feature scientists, engineers, entrepreneurs and companies who are venturing into these two unique domains and highlight their discoveries. From drone work in the Antarctic aimed at understanding climate change to human performance research on the International Space Station weâ€™ll be discussing the challenges and parallels between these extreme environments, educating the community, and inspiring future explorers.</p>
<p>Why We Go started as an initiative of <a href="http://waypaverfoundation.org/">WayPaver Foundation</a> and you can read our <a href="http://waypaverfoundation.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/Vol1WWG.pdf">first publication here</a> which was focused on profiling promising individuals in the space industry.

<h4>Who We Are<h4>
<p>Why We Go is run by Patrick Gray, a PhD student in Duke University's Marine Robotics and Remote Sensing Lab. Read more on <a href="http://patrickgray.me/">Patrick's website</a>.
